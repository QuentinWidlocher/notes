## Why ??

Ok so, I've grown fond of Remix obviously. But the thing I like the most about it, is how it helped me learned about the basics of the web, and even made me think about "how did we make websites before the Javascript ecosystem I know and love ?"

Of course the answer is "mainly with PHP".  
I had to give a course on PHP a few days ago so I got back to it after several years of Javascript and it struck me how
similar its principles are with Remix. (or the other way around of course).

The only thing that makes it hard for me to enjoy is the lack of a proper templating system. String concatenation of html tags feels so clunky to me, and I'm not used to the PHP syntax at all.

That's when I thought, "wouldn't it be cool to use this old school approach with more modern tools".  
By "with more modern tools", I mean "with Javascript" of course. 😁

## What I want to do

I want to create a tool that's easy to learn and use, and makes a big use of the fundamentals of Javascript and the web.
I won't create a web server so I'll use Express, but I'll try to leverage Express capabilities the best I can.  
The same goes for the templating system, I don't want to integrate JSX as I feel the \``template string ${interpolation}`\` is powerful enough.

This tool should allow beginners to build websites easily, while having a good understanding of what's going on behind the scenes so I want to keep my source code as clear as possible.

I know a lot of tools out there feels too magical for me (Angular, and even Vue still have parts I'm not 100% confident about) and I really want to make the users feel like nothing can go wrong because they know all process.

## What I don't want to do

I don't care if this tool will lack functionality, or if it's too slow or whatever, I don't want to compete with Remix _at all_ (it's not like I could anyway 😂)

Also, it's not a big deal if the final user experience is not top-notch. If the page blinks for half a second when you click a button, so be it, that's what's happening with old vanilla PHP in any case.

This tool is about learning first, but if it allows people to create cool websites too I'd be happy ! Maybe I'll try making a (kind of) complex web app with it, to showcase what it's possible to achieve.

## How I want it to work

First, I made a list of all the functionalities I think are needed in a web framework and split them into two groups :

### The must-have

- Serving html file (obviously)
- Serving static assets
- Having a templating system (for conditional rendering or loops)
- Having a way to run Javascript code server-side (and to use this code in the template)
- Responding to html forms

That would be enough to create a nice dynamic website. You could compute some data, and display it logically in your file.

It's kind of bare-bone but it's a great basis for the more advanced features coming next.

### The bonus

- Allowing layouts pages, or chunks of reusable templates (think of components in React, or layout routes in Remix)
- Allowing nested routes and route parameters (like `/users/QuentinWidlocher/edit`)
- Add local and global state to the application (local as in per-page states)
- Add some configuration to the server (hosting dir, change the port, the default error page etc.)
- Refining the developer experience (errors display, watch mode etc.)

This would bring the framework to a higher standard, while keeping it quite simple I hope.  
This version would be one I'd actually use and not just something only for learning.

### No wheels to reinvent

Ok, so as I said, we'll try to minimize custom code as much as possible so let's see what is _not_ needed and can be replaced by something we already have :

Express gives us :

- File serving (html and static assets)
- Request data (query parameters)
- Form data (Post body and form parsing to object)
- Dynamic routes (with route parameters)

Javascript (and node) gives us :

- "Arbitrary" code execution (so we can execute code from a string)
- Powerful and nested string interpolation with template literals
- Asynchronous code easily with `async`/`await`
- An easy way to pass props around by `...spread`ing them to function arguments
- Libraries to fetch data and interact with files in the file system

Whew, that's a lot of things we _won't_ have to do right ? What's left then ?

- Serving html files and assets **based on their route**
- Parsing the server code and getting back values
- Pass those values to the template
- Interpreting the template to produce a string result
- Find a way to store states in each routes.

That's... pretty much it, our job will be to link together existing features provided by the environment itself.  
Not having to deal with the template parsing and file serving is _a lot_ less work than it would have been.

In the next part, we'll start by a quick overview of our two main parts, Express and the Javascript template strings.
